## About the project

### Built with dotnet


### Get started

> Prerequisites\
1.visual studio has to be installed for macos or windows \
2.Also possible via homebrew -> install homebrew via 
                /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"\ \
                2.brew install mono\
            

> Installation -> using mcs is also possible. csc is what i used (regarding the compiler) 

> command to run it through csc -> `csc hanoi.cs && mono hanoi.exe`


### Usage


### 1. Tower of hanoi problem

* How to run `dotnet build && dotnet run`

* code is commented in each line to understand on whats happening

* a modular approach (function based) on the problem. which i found easier to explain and write.

* hanoi.js -> please refer to this file to understand the basic principles of recursion. where multiple examples explain and get you to understand the hanoi problem much more effectively. (Only if you need to)
explained at a more modular level with inline commenting

* hanoi.cs -> Was not able to use dotnet for this and mono or any other preferred compiler should be used to run this program.

* The ascii art comprises of asteriks and shows the disk or rod at each stage.



### Roadmap
### 1.Tasks to do for both

- [x] Basic implementation with comments

- [x] Markdown completion

- [ ] Time it function for each language. will be added later to my github repo

- [ ] Implementation in other languages eg:- python, c and c++, js

- [ ] ascii art viz time delay added (For more clear viewing)

### 2. Table for execution times


| File  | Language | Time (seconds) |
| ------------- |            |       |
| program.cs      | c sharp     |       |   
| bubblesort.cs  | c sharp     |       |
| mergesort.cs | c sharp      |       |
|bubblesort.c | c |             |
|bubblesort.cpp | cpp |         |
| bubblesort.js| javascript|    |
