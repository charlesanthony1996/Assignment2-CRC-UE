The two folders are divided into two

Assignment2 -> sort folder (couldnt fix the name change the last minute)

hanoi_ascii -> hanoi folder

Note -> If you want to run individual files from the two folders. you have to comment all .cs files
        and then paste the one you want to run to program.cs. and if there are no additional args to run
        the command is -> dotnet build && dotnet run.

        make sure that every other program is commented out as the dotnet command searches for the program class 
        in all files... ^^ something that i had to learn along the way..
